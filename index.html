                                <p> I grew up in the incredible, often grey and beyond uncomfortably-cold, crime-ridden city known as Chicago. The food
                                    scene and summertime festivities is what makes it all more than worthwhile. However, with a core temperature
                                    comparable to a lizard, Chicago winters were especially brutal. That's why, when the opportunity to move to Austin
                                    presented itself, I jumped on it. Of course, this meant, at the age of 26, I finally needed to learn how to drive.

                                <p>I've spent most of my working career in leadership roles at food-related environments. From managing the cafeteria
                                    at the
                                    <a href="https://www.kentlaw.iit.edu/">second oldest law school in Chicago</a>, to holding a management role at a Chicago founded and based
                                    <a href="http://investors.chefswarehouse.com/news-releases/news-release-details/chefs-warehouse-acquires-chicago-based-mt-food-service-inc">food distribution company</a> with annual net sales of $50M. Since moving to Austin, I served a short stint as
                                    an Administrative Assistant at a
                                    <a href="http://www.servprohydeparkcentralaustin.com/">Residential and Commercial Restoration company</a>. This position included filing insurance claims and required
                                    an
                                    <a href="https://www.iicrc.org/">IICRC</a> certification in Water Damage Restoration, in addition to the corporation's multiple internal certifications.
                                    For the past 5 years I've put those driving skills to use, commuting 40 miles roundtrip, to serve as the Administrative
                                    Assistant & Application Processor for the
                                    <a href="www.ltisdschools.org/FANS">Food & Nutrition Services Department</a> at a public school district in the Hill Country. Least we forget, I
                                    entered the district in the roll of a bouffant hairnet wearing lunch lady for a few months before quickly realizing
                                    I prefer standing desks to standing on my feet all day and that I have little to no rapport with elementary-aged
                                    children.
